post_content = "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mobility is about enabling untethered use of business networks, applications and data to enhance availability, response times, processing efficiency and more. Mobile device management can do more than stop bad things from happening -- it can also enable workers to be more productive. Achieving that benefit begins with identifying your workforce’s mobility needs.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wireless business traffic is expected to nearly double between 2013 and 2015, driven largely by mobile devices, according to Forrester Research’s 2013 mobility survey. For this reason, examining the traffic carried by your WLAN can be a good way to spot emerging mobile application use within your workforce.</p>"
