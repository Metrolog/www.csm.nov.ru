post_content = "<strong>Amazon entered the smartphone business Wednesday -- and made a big splash doing it.</strong>

At an event in Seattle, the retail giant unveiled the Fire Phone, a high-end, 3-D smartphone. It is the first smartphone Amazon  has produced on its own.

<strong>Display:  </strong>The Fire Phone has a 3-D, 4.7-inch high-definition display. It uses infrared lights and cameras mounted on the phone's surface to track a user's head movements and render images accordingly. Bezos compared the Fire Phone's 3-D feature to the introduction of geometric perspective and the vanishing point in 14th century artworks."
