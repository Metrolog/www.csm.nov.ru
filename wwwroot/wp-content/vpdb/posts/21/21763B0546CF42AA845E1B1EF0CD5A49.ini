post_content = "<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Corporate kits may be purchased from a legal stationery store. A corporate kit usually contains a corporate seal, blank stock certificates and forms for the adoption of by-laws and recording the minutes of meetings. Rather than composing their own forms, some may find it easier to use the preprinted forms provided in a corporate kit. Please note that New York State law does not require a corporation to have a seal. Your telephone book's yellow pages or a yellow pages information operator (your area code + 555-1212) may be helpful in locating a legal stationery store.</span>"
